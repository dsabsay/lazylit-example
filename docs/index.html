        <h1> What is lazylit? </h1>
        <p>
            Lazylit is a collection of heavily documented source code files. Each page of documentation hosted here is written for a specific revision/commit of a source code file that lives somewhere else (i.e. a repository in GitHub).
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted a simple way to share extensive code comments without the ongoing maintenance burden and inevitable code/comment drift that is characteristic of traditional code commenting practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've often heard advice that usually sounds like "don't use advanced features of a language/tool, because it makes code harder to understand".
            With a tool like GNU <code>make</code>, a lot of these "advanced" features can replace dozens of lines of bespoke shell scripts.
            Following this advice then turns an opportunity to learn a common tool <i>well</i> into a grueling slog through a coworker's (or your own) buggy mess.
            Instead of avoiding certain features and tools, I believe that a well-written set of notes (with links to relevant documentation) can go a long way in improving code understandability.
            There are thousands of programming tools and languages; most people only know a few.
            For <code>make</code> in particular, my (limited) experience has shown me that programmers without experience in C are likely to be unfamiliar with <code>make</code> in general.
            Expecting that all code should be immediately understandable to anyone at first glance is unrealistic.
            But we can certainly leave clues behind us that point readers <i>toward</i> understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            But fancy tool/language features are not the only thing worth documenting in this way.
            <i>Project</i>- and <i>team</i>-specific conventions and patterns are worth documenting as well.
            For example, if all your team's projects have a Makefile with a similar structure, an explanation of that structure and pattern could accelerate a new developer's ability to read and understand the team's projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approaching existing code bases is one of the hardest things I've had to do as a programmer. This project as an attempt to address that challenge. I hope it will make the lives of my coworkers easier by making it easier for new developers to learn about the conventions and tricks used in codebases I work on.
        </p>
        <h2> Why not store the explanation in the repo, next to the source itself? </h2>
        <p>
            Storing an explanation next to the code (either in comments, as separate files, or using a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> tool) comes with the expectation that it is always kept up-to-date with the source.
            This incurs a maintenance burden, which I felt would be too cumbersome and in fact, unnecessary.
            The focus should be on explaining the <i>patterns</i> and the <i>features</i> or <i>paradigms</i> being used; the things that will help a developer read the code itself.
            Thus, an explanation written against a version of the code slightly out of date should still be useful, because they can apply what they learn to the newer code.
        </p>

        <p>
            I borrowed heavily from the <a href="http://ashkenas.com/docco/">Docco</a> project and its derivatives. I am especially grateful for Nikhil Marathe's golang port of Docco, <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/gocco">gocco</a>, from which I borrowed (i.e. copied) a large portion of this code.
